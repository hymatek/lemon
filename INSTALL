Installation Instructions
=========================

   Since you are reading this I assume you already obtained one of the release
tarballs and successfully extracted it. The latest version of LEMON is
available at our webpage (http://lemon.cs.elte.hu/).

   In order to install LEMON from the extracted source tarball you have to
issue the following commands:

  1. `cd lemon-x.y.z'

     This changes to the directory which was created when you extracted the
     sources. The x.y.z part is a version number.

  2. `./configure'

     This runs the configure shell script, which does some checks and
     configuration (creates makefiles etc).

  3. `make'

     This command compiles the non-template part of LEMON into libemon.a file.
     It also compiles the benchmark and demo programs when enabled.

  4. `make check'

     This step is optional, but recommended. It runs the test programs that we
     developed for LEMON to check whether the library works properly on your
     platform.

  5. `make install'

     This command installs LEMON under /usr/local (you will need root
     privileges to be able to do that). If you want to install it to some
     other location, then pass the --prefix=DIRECTORY flag to configure in
     step 1. For example: `./configure --prefix=/home/username/lemon'


Configure Flags
===============

   You can pass the following flags to configure in step 1
(see ./configure --help for more):

CXX=comp

  Change the C++ compiler to 'comp'.

CXXFLAGS='flags'

  Pass the 'flags' to the compiler. For example
  CXXFLAGS='-O3 -march=pentium-m'
  turns  on generation of aggressively optimized
  Pentium-M specific code.

--enable-demo

   Build the demo programs too.

--disable-demo

   Do not build the demo programs (default).

--enable-benchmark

   Build the benchmark programs too.

--disable-benchmark

   Do not build the benchmark programs (default).

--with-glpk[=PREFIX]

   Enable GLPK support (default). You should specify the prefix too if
   you installed GLPK to some non-standard location (e.g. your home
   directory). If it is not found, GLPK support will be disabled.

--with-glpk-includedir=DIR

   The directory where the GLPK header files are located. This is only
   useful when the GLPK headers and libraries are not under the same
   prefix (which is unlikely).

--with-glpk-libdir=DIR

   The directory where the GLPK libraries are located. This is only
   useful when the GLPK headers and libraries are not under the same
   prefix (which is unlikely).

--without-glpk

   Disable GLPK support.

--with-cplex[=PREFIX]

   Enable CPLEX support (default). You should specify the prefix too
   if you installed CPLEX to some non-standard location
   (e.g. /opt/ilog/cplex75). If it is not found, CPLEX support will be
   disabled.

--with-cplex-includedir=DIR

   The directory where the CPLEX header files are located. This is
   only useful when the CPLEX headers and libraries are not under the
   same prefix (e.g.  /usr/local/cplex/cplex75/include).

--with-cplex-libdir=DIR

   The directory where the CPLEX libraries are located. This is only
   useful when the CPLEX headers and libraries are not under the same
   prefix (e.g.
   /usr/local/cplex/cplex75/lib/i86_linux2_glibc2.2_gcc3.0/static_pic_mt).

--without-cplex

   Disable CPLEX support.
