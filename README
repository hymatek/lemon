LEMON - a Library of Efficient Models and Optimization in Networks
------------------------------------------------------------------

LEMON is the abbreviation of Library of Efficient Models and
Optimization in Networks. It is an open source library written in
C++. It provides a set of easy-to-use implementation of common data
structures and algorithms in the area of optimization and helps
implementing new ones. It is an especially suitable tool to solve the
design and optimization problems of telecommunications networks. To
achieve wide usability, a fundamental design requirement is the
genericity of interface of data structures and algorithms. LEMON is an
open source library end invites people all around the world in its
development.
